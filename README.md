A local bridge server that watches AI coding agent session files and broadcasts lightweight activity events over WebSocket. Designed for the [Pixel Office](https://github.com/waynedev9598/pixel-office) iOS app — a pixel-art visualization of your coding activity.

> **Open source & provenance-verified** — Every npm release is [cryptographically linked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixelhq#provenance) to the exact source commit that built it. You can audit the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/waynedev9598/PixelHQ-bridge).

### Supported Agents

- **Claude Code** — fully supported today
- **Cursor** — coming soon
- **Codex** — coming soon
- **Antigravity** — coming soon
- More to follow

## Quick Start

```bash
npx pixelhq
```

An interactive welcome screen walks you through what the bridge does and how it works. Select **Start bridge** to begin.

Once running, the bridge displays a **6-digit pairing code**. Enter it in the Pixel Office iOS app to connect — the app auto-discovers the server via Bonjour on your local network.

```
  ✓ Claude Code detected at ~/.claude
  ✓ WebSocket server on port 8765
  ✓ Broadcasting on local network (192.168.1.100)

## Privacy — Nothing Sensitive Leaves Your Machine

This is a **local-only** server. It binds to your machine, broadcasts only on your local network, and **never contacts any external service**.

The bridge reads Claude Code's raw JSONL session logs — which contain everything: your prompts, file contents, API keys in tool results, thinking text, bash commands, etc. **None of that is broadcast.** Every event goes through a strict privacy-stripping pipeline before it reaches the WebSocket.

### What IS broadcast

Only structural metadata needed to animate the pixel-art office:

| Data | Example | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| Event type | `"tool"`, `"activity"` | Determines animation |
| Tool category | `"file_read"`, `"terminal"` | Character walks to correct desk |
| Action | `"thinking"`, `"responding"` | Controls character animation |
| Status | `"started"`, `"completed"` | Start/stop animation |
| File basename | `"auth.ts"` | Shows on character's screen |
| Grep/glob pattern | `"TODO"`, `"*.ts"` | Shows on character's screen |
| Bash description | `"Run tests"` | The user-provided label, not the command |
| Agent type | `"explore"`, `"plan"` | Spawns new character |
| Token counts | `{ input: 5000, output: 200 }` | Numbers only |
| Project name | `"pixel-office"` | Last path segment only |
| Timestamps | ISO-8601 | Event ordering |
| Session/event IDs | UUIDs | Correlation |

### What is NOT broadcast

All content is stripped before broadcast. This includes:

| Sensitive data | How it's handled |
|----------------|-----------------|
| File contents | Stripped entirely — only the basename is kept |
| Code (edits, writes) | Stripped — old/new strings never leave |
| Bash commands | Stripped — only the optional `description` field is used |
| Thinking text | Stripped — never included |
| Assistant responses | Stripped — never included |
| User prompts | Stripped — only the presence of a prompt is noted |
| Tool result output | Stripped — only success/error status is kept |
| Full file paths | Stripped to basename (`/Users/you/project/src/auth.ts` → `auth.ts`) |
| Full project paths | Stripped to last segment (`/Users/you/Projects/my-app` → `my-app`) |
| URLs (WebFetch) | Stripped entirely |
| Search queries (WebSearch) | Stripped entirely |
| Task prompts | Stripped — only the agent type (`explore`, `bash`) is kept |
| Todo content | Stripped — only the count (`"3 items"`) is kept |
| Error messages | Stripped — only the severity (`warning`/`error`) is kept |
| API keys, secrets | Never included — content fields are never broadcast |

### How stripping works

The pipeline has three stages:

```
JSONL file  →  Parser  →  Adapter  →  WebSocket
(raw data)    (parse)    (strip)     (broadcast)
```

1. **Parser** (`src/parser.ts`) — Reads raw JSONL, parses JSON, passes structured data to the adapter.
2. **Adapter** (`src/adapters/claude-code.ts`) — The privacy gate. Uses an explicit allowlist per tool to extract only safe fields. Unknown tools produce no context at all.
3. **Broadcast** (`src/websocket.ts`) — Sends the already-filtered events to connected clients. No additional data is added.

Privacy utilities (`toBasename`, `toProjectName` in `src/pixel-events.ts`) ensure paths are always stripped to their last segment.

### Test-verified

The test suite includes dedicated privacy tests that feed sensitive data (API keys, passwords, file paths, secrets) through the full pipeline and assert **none of it appears in broadcast output**:

```
tests/pipeline.test.ts            → Full pipeline privacy verification
tests/claude-code-adapter.test.ts → Per-tool privacy audit
```

Run them yourself:

```bash
npm test
```

```

1. **Watch** — Monitors Claude Code's append-only JSONL session files using chokidar
2. **Parse** — Parses each new line as JSON, routes to the correct adapter
3. **Transform** — Adapter strips sensitive content, maps tools to categories, produces normalized events
4. **Broadcast** — Sends events over WebSocket to connected clients on the local network
5. **Discover** — Advertises via Bonjour/mDNS so the iOS app finds the server automatically
6. **Authenticate** — Devices must pair with a one-time 6-digit code to receive events. Tokens persist across restarts.

## Event Schema

Every WebSocket message has this envelope:

```json
{ "type": "event", "payload": { ...PixelEvent } }
```

### Session

```json
{
  "type": "session",
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "action": "started",
  "project": "my-app"
}
```

Actions: `started`, `ended`

### Activity

```json
{
  "type": "activity",
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "action": "thinking"
}
```

Actions: `thinking`, `responding`, `waiting`, `user_prompt`

### Tool

```json
{
  "type": "tool",
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "tool": "file_read",
  "detail": "read",
  "status": "started",
  "context": "auth.ts"
}
```

Tool categories: `file_read`, `file_write`, `terminal`, `search`, `plan`, `communicate`, `spawn_agent`, `notebook`, `other`

### Agent

```json
{
  "type": "agent",
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "action": "spawned",
  "agentRole": "explore"
}
```

Actions: `spawned`, `completed`, `error`

### Summary

```json
{
  "type": "summary",
  "sessionId": "abc-123"
}
```

Emitted at the end of a conversation turn. The iOS app uses this to immediately begin the idle/cooling transition (no wait for the full idle timer).

### Error

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "sessionId": "abc-123",
  "severity": "error"
}
```

## Publishing

Releases are published to npm automatically via GitHub Actions with [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) — every published version is cryptographically linked to the exact source commit that built it. No code is published from a local machine.

### One-time setup

1. **Create an npm account** at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) (if you don't have one)
2. **Generate an access token** — go to npmjs.com → Access Tokens → Generate New Token → select **Automation**
3. **Add the token to GitHub** — go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret → name it `NPM_TOKEN`, paste the token

### Releasing a new version

Bump the `version` in `package.json` and push to `main`. That's it.

```bash
npm version patch   # or minor / major
git push
```

CI detects the version change, runs tests, builds, and publishes to npm with provenance. If the version hasn't changed, CI skips the publish step.

Users can verify provenance on the [npm package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixelhq) — it shows the exact commit, repo, and workflow that produced each version.
